# TaskFlow ✨

Get stuff done. Actually.

Because your brain is terrible at remembering things but great at doing them.

## What is this?

A to-do app that doesn't suck. Built with:

🎨 **Neubrutalism design** - bold, colorful, in your face  
⚡ **Fast as hell** - no loading spinners  
🎯 **Smart categories** - Work, Personal, whatever you need  
💾 **Local storage** - your tasks stay on your device  
🎵 **Audio cues** - satisfying clicks and completion sounds

## Why another todo app?

Because I tried Todoist, Things, Notion, TickTick... all too complicated.

Sometimes you just need:
- Add task
- Check box
- Feel accomplished

That's TaskFlow.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open. Add tasks. Done.

## Features I'm proud of

- **Drag & drop** - organize by dragging
- **Color coding** - visual priority levels
- **Confetti** 🎊 - when you finish tasks (yes, really)
- **No bloat** - does one thing well
